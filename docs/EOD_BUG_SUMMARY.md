# EOD Liquidation Bug - Quick Summary

**Status**: üö® CRITICAL BUG CONFIRMED
**File**: `megadocs/EOD_LIQUIDATION_BUG_CRITICAL.md` (Full Details)

## The Bug in 30 Seconds

**Problem**: EOD liquidation at 3:55-4:00 PM ET was **completely skipped** due to idempotency logic flaw.

**What Happened**:
1. System started at 3:34 PM on 2025-10-08
2. EOD state file already had `2025-10-08` (from earlier session)
3. At 3:56 PM: EOD window active, but `is_eod_complete()` returned TRUE
4. EOD check: `if (... && !is_eod_complete())` ‚Üí FALSE ‚Üí **SKIPPED**
5. Market closed with 2,732 SH shares ($100K) still open

**Root Cause**: Idempotency check doesn't account for intraday restarts with new positions.

## The Fix (30 Minutes)

### Add this flag:
```cpp
bool positions_opened_after_eod_{false};
```

### Set after opening positions:
```cpp
positions_opened_after_eod_ = true;  // In execute_trade()
```

### Enhanced EOD check:
```cpp
if (is_end_of_day_liquidation_time()) {
    bool need_liquidation = !eod_state_.is_eod_complete(today_et) ||
                           positions_opened_after_eod_;

    if (need_liquidation && has_positions()) {
        liquidate_all_positions();
        eod_state_.mark_eod_complete(today_et);
        positions_opened_after_eod_ = false;
    }
    return;
}
```

## Evidence

**EOD State File**:
```
2025-10-08
```
(Already marked complete from earlier session)

**Log at 3:56 PM**:
```
[2025-10-08 15:56:03] üïê Regular Trading Hours - processing for signals
```
‚ùå Should say: "üîî END OF DAY - Liquidation window active"

**Alpaca Account Now**:
```
Symbol: SH
Quantity: 2,732 shares
Value: $100,073
```
‚ùå Should be: 100% cash
