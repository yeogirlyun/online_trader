# Bug Report Review Summary

**Date:** October 15, 2025
**Task:** Review ROTATION_TRADING_NAN_BUG_REPORT.md after code cleanup

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Configuration File Reference Updated

**File:** `megadocs/ROTATION_TRADING_NAN_BUG_REPORT.md`  
**Line 242:** Updated config file path

**Before:**
```markdown
**File:** `config/rotation_strategy_v2.json`
```

**After:**
```markdown
**File:** `config/rotation_strategy.json`
```

**Reason:** Config file was renamed during cleanup to comply with PROJECT_RULES.md (no version suffixes).

---

## Verification Checks Performed

### ✅ No References to Removed PolygonClient Files
- Confirmed bug report does NOT reference:
  - `polygon_client_old.cpp`
  - `polygon_client.cpp` 
  - `polygon_websocket.cpp`
- **Reason:** These files were not involved in the rotation trading NaN bug.

### ✅ Strategy Adapters Not Referenced
- Bug report does NOT reference `strategy_adapters.h`
- **Reason:** Strategy adapters are not part of rotation trading system.

### ✅ Source Module List Accurate
- Section "Source Module Reference" correctly lists only 18 files involved in the bug
- All listed files exist and are relevant to the NaN bug

## Historical Documentation Status

The following **historical/archival** megadocs still reference removed files:
- `megadocs/MARS_REGIME_DETECTION_ISSUE_MEGADOC.md`
- `megadocs/PHASES_2_3_4_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`
- `megadocs/PRODUCTION_READINESS_WITH_SOURCE.md`
- `megadocs/LIBWEBSOCKETS_CONNECTION_FAILURE.md`
- `megadocs/signal_generation_hang_bug.md`

**Decision:** These docs are historical records from October 7-8, 2025 and should NOT be modified. They document the codebase state at that time.

---

## Current Documentation Status

Active documentation files in `docs/` directory checked:
- **LIVE_TRADING_GUIDE.md**: References `polygon_websocket_fifo.cpp` (CORRECT - file still exists)
- **MOCK_INFRASTRUCTURE_*.md**: File list checks performed
- No incorrect references to removed files found in active docs

---

## Bug Report Status

**Status:** ✅ FULLY UPDATED AND CONSISTENT

The ROTATION_TRADING_NAN_BUG_REPORT.md is now:
1. ✅ Consistent with current codebase after cleanup
2. ✅ References correct configuration file name
3. ✅ Contains accurate source module listing
4. ✅ No references to removed/renamed files
5. ✅ Ready for use in debugging NaN features issue

---

## Recommendation

**No further updates needed.** The bug report accurately reflects the current codebase and is ready to be used for continuing investigation of the NaN features bug (Bug #2, still ongoing).
