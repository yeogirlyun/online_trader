# Session Summary - October 10, 2025

## Completed Work

### 1. ✅ Signal Caching System Implementation

**Objective**: Achieve 3-5x optimization speedup by caching expensive signal generation

**Implementation**:
- Created `scripts/signal_cache.py` (340 lines)
  - `SignalCache` class with hash-based cache keys
  - `CacheStats` class for performance tracking
  - Automatic cache save/load with metadata
  - 24-hour expiration for freshness

- Integrated into `scripts/run_2phase_optuna.py`
  - Initialize cache at start of backtesting
  - Check cache before each signal generation
  - Save generated signals for reuse
  - Report cache statistics per trial

**Bug Fixed**:
- `UnboundLocalError` with numpy import
- Moved import to top of method (was conditional)

**Expected Performance**:
- Phase 1: 80-95% cache hit rate → 3.3x speedup
- Phase 2: ~100% cache hit rate → 25x speedup
- Overall: 100min → 17min optimization time

**Status**: Implemented and committed (02b7618)

**Documentation**: `SIGNAL_CACHING_IMPLEMENTATION.md`

### 2. ✅ Optimization Improvements

**From Previous Session** (commit 255163c):

1. **Balanced CHOPPY Threshold Ranges**:
   - Old: buy (0.52-0.60), sell (0.40-0.48) → 10pp gap
   - New: buy (0.505-0.55), sell (0.45-0.495) → 4-6pp gap
   - Expected: 5-10x more actionable signals

2. **Recent Data Focus**:
   - Changed from 100 blocks (6 months) to 40 blocks (2.5 months)
   - More responsive to current market conditions

3. **Regime-Specific Min Gap**:
   - CHOPPY: 0.01 (tighter spreads)
   - TRENDING: 0.04 (moderate)
   - HIGH_VOLATILITY: 0.08 (conservative)

4. **Minimum Trade Frequency Constraint**:
   - Reject trials with < 5 trades in test period
   - Prevents "stay in cash" solutions

5. **Probability Distribution Logging**:
   - Log Day 0 signal distribution for debugging
   - Shows LONG/SHORT signal counts

**Documentation**: `OPTIMIZATION_IMPROVEMENTS_SUMMARY.md`

### 3. ✅ Comprehensive Bug Analysis

**From Previous Session**:
- Created `LOW_MRD_DETAILED_ANALYSIS_REPORT.md`
- Initially too comprehensive (listed all 96 source files)
- **Revised** to include only 12 relevant modules
- User feedback: "the bug report should not list source modules that are not related to the bug report content"

**Key Findings**:
1. **Symbol Detection Bug** (FIXED): Temp files lacked "SPY" in filename
2. **Conservative CHOPPY Behavior** (ADJUSTED): Thresholds too wide, now balanced

## Current Status

### 🔄 In Progress: Mock Optimization Test

**Command**: `./scripts/launch_trading.sh mock --date 2025-10-09`

**Status**: Running since 7:18 AM (4+ hours)

**Observations**:
1. **Optimization Phase Failed** (numpy bug - now fixed)
   - All 9 trials rejected for < 5 trades
   - Probability distributions look good (60-114 LONG, 46-80 SHORT)
   - Issue: Trials still have 0 trades despite balanced ranges

2. **Mock Trading Session Running**
   - Using fallback default parameters (optimization failed)
   - Using hardcoded PSM thresholds (0.49-0.55 → CASH_ONLY)
   - Currently at 2:47 PM (near end of day)
   - Equity: $99,426 (down from $100k)
   - Mostly staying in CASH_ONLY (probabilities in NEUTRAL zone)

### 🔍 Cache Performance Test

**Quick 3-trial test** (completed):
- All trials: 0% cache hit rate (expected - different signal params per trial)
- Trial 0: lambda=0.994, bb=0.19 → 30 cache misses (correct)
- Trial 1: lambda=0.985, bb=0.23 → 30 cache misses (correct)
- Trial 2: lambda=0.985, bb=0.25 → 30 cache misses (correct)

**Cache works correctly**: Each trial has unique signal params, so cache misses are expected. Benefits will show in Phase 2 where Phase 1 params are fixed.

## Outstanding Issues

### Issue 1: Optimization Still Rejecting All Trials

**Problem**: Despite balanced CHOPPY ranges (0.505-0.55 / 0.45-0.495), trials produce 0 trades

**Evidence**:
- Day 0 probability distributions look reasonable
- Trial 0: 74 LONG (>=0.52), 80 SHORT (<=0.49) signals
- Trial 1: 114 LONG (>=0.51), 56 SHORT (<=0.45) signals
- But execution produces 0 trades over 30 days

**Hypothesis**: The issue is not in signal generation but in trade execution:
1. Signals are generated correctly
2. But `execute-trades` command may have issues
3. Or min-hold-period constraint is too restrictive
4. Or EOD enforcement is preventing trades

**Next Steps**:
1. Debug why signals aren't converting to trades
2. Check `execute-trades` command logic
3. Review min-hold-period (currently 3 bars)
4. Check EOD enforcement timing

### Issue 2: Phase 2 Crashes When n_trials=0

**Error**: `ValueError: No trials are completed yet.`

**Location**: `phase2_optimize()` trying to access `study.best_trial` when no trials run

**Fix Needed**: Skip Phase 2 if `n_trials_phase2 == 0`

2. Debug why signals aren't converting to trades
3. Run full optimization with fixed code
4. Validate cache performance in Phase 2

1. If optimization successful → deploy to live trading
2. Monitor live performance with new parameters
3. Iterate based on results
