## 🎯 Mock Infrastructure Validation

### ✅ Successful Components

1. **Mock Time Synchronization**
   - Bar timestamps correctly used instead of wall-clock time
   - Trading hours detection working perfectly
   - After-hours detection at 4:00 PM confirmed

2. **MockBroker**
   - Market prices updated from incoming bars
   - Orders executed with realistic fill prices
   - Position tracking accurate
   - SELL orders now properly logged

3. **Unified Live/Mock Architecture**
   - Same code path for both modes (dependency injection)
   - No code duplication
   - Perfect consistency between live and mock

4. **SELL Order Logging** (NEW FIX)
   - Previously: Only BUY orders were logged
   - Now: Both BUY and SELL orders captured
   - Fix: Added synthetic Order logging in `execute_transition()` when closing positions

## 🔧 Technical Fixes Applied

### Timestamp Synchronization Bug Fix
**Problem**: Charts showed trades starting around bar 200 instead of bar 0
**Root Cause**: Python `datetime.strptime()` parsed "2025-10-07 09:30:00" as local time instead of ET, creating 13-hour offset
**Solution**: Used `bar_timestamp_ms` field directly from signals instead of parsing timestamp strings
**Result**: All trades now correctly aligned with SPY price bars from bar 0 onward
