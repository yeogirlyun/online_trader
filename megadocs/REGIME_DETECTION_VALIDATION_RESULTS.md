# Regime Detection Validation Test Results

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: ✅ Testing Infrastructure Complete | ⚠️ Synthetic Data Needs Tuning

---

## Summary

Successfully created comprehensive regime detection validation system using synthetic data. The testing framework is fully functional, but initial results reveal that synthetic data generation parameters need tuning to create distinct market regimes.

**Accuracy**: 20% (3/15 tests passed)
**Issue**: All regimes detected as LOW_VOLATILITY except the LOW_VOLATILITY segment itself

---

## What We Built

### 1. Synthetic Data Generator (`scripts/generate_regime_test_data.py`)
- Generates 4800 bars (10 blocks) of SPY data
- 5 distinct regimes: TRENDING_UP, TRENDING_DOWN, CHOPPY, HIGH_VOLATILITY, LOW_VOLATILITY
- 2 blocks (960 bars) per regime
- Uses random walk with drift and configurable volatility

### 2. C++ Test Program (`tests/test_regime_detector.cpp`)
- Loads synthetic CSV data
- Tests regime detector on known regime segments
- Validates detection accuracy
- Outputs detailed regime analysis

### 3. Build Integration
- Added to CMakeLists.txt
- Builds successfully with `make test_regime_detector`
- Self-contained CSV parser (no external dependencies)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Problem 1: Compounding Price Drift
**Issue**: Each regime starts from the previous regime's ending price, creating compounding effects.

```python
# Current implementation:
current_price = BASE_PRICE  # 450
# After TRENDING_UP: 860
# After TRENDING_DOWN: 352
# After CHOPPY: 320
# After HIGH_VOLATILITY: 35  ← Price collapsed!
# After LOW_VOLATILITY: 30
```

**Impact**: Later regimes have very different price levels, distorting volatility calculations.

### Problem 2: Weak Regime Characteristics
Current parameters may not create distinct regimes:

```python
TRENDING_UP:    drift=+0.001, vol=0.01  # 0.1% per bar
TRENDING_DOWN:  drift=-0.001, vol=0.01
CHOPPY:         drift=0,      vol=0.005
HIGH_VOLATILITY: drift=0,     vol=0.025  # Should be higher
LOW_VOLATILITY:  drift=0,     vol=0.003
```

### Problem 3: Detector Thresholds
Current ADX/volatility thresholds may not be calibrated for synthetic data:

```cpp
// In MarketRegimeDetector::detect_regime()
const double ADX_TREND_THRESHOLD = 25.0;
const double VOLATILITY_HIGH_THRESHOLD = 1.2;
const double VOLATILITY_LOW_THRESHOLD = 0.8;
```

---

## Proposed Fixes

### Fix 1: Reset Price Between Regimes
```python
for mars_regime, our_regime in REGIMES:
    price = BASE_PRICE  # ← Reset to 450 for each regime
    # Generate 960 bars with this regime's characteristics
```

**Benefit**: Each regime starts from same baseline, preventing compounding drift.

### Fix 2: Stronger Regime Characteristics
```python
TRENDING_UP:
    drift = 0.003     # 0.3% per bar (was 0.1%)
    volatility = 0.015

TRENDING_DOWN:
    drift = -0.003
    volatility = 0.015

CHOPPY:
    drift = 0.0
    volatility = 0.008  # Slightly higher

HIGH_VOLATILITY:
    drift = 0.0
    volatility = 0.05   # Much higher (was 0.025)

LOW_VOLATILITY:
    drift = 0.0
    volatility = 0.002  # Very low
```

### Fix 3: Add Trend Strength for ADX
```python
# For TRENDING regimes, add directional movement
if mars_regime in ["trending_up", "trending_down"]:
    # Ensure ADX will detect trend
    # Add consistent directional bars (e.g., 70% up bars for trending_up)
    trend_bias = 0.7  # 70% of bars move in trend direction
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate (Fix Synthetic Data)
1. **Update data generator** with fixes above
2. **Regenerate test data**:
   ```bash
   python3 scripts/generate_regime_test_data.py
   ```
3. **Rerun validation**:
   ```bash
   ./build/test_regime_detector data/equities/SPY_regime_test.csv
   ```
4. **Target**: ≥80% accuracy

### Follow-up (Optional Detector Tuning)
1. **If accuracy still <80%**, tune detector thresholds:
   - Lower ADX_TREND_THRESHOLD to 20.0
   - Adjust VOLATILITY thresholds to match synthetic data
2. **Add debug output** to show indicator values:
   - Print ADX, ATR, slope for each test
   - Compare to expected values

### Production (Use Real Data)
1. **Test on real SPY data** with known characteristics
2. **Validate on different time periods**:
   - 2020 March crash (HIGH_VOLATILITY)
   - 2021 bull market (TRENDING_UP)
   - 2022 sideways (CHOPPY)
3. **Measure accuracy on real regimes**

### ⚠️ What Needs Work
1. **Synthetic data generation**
   - Price compounding creates unrealistic scenarios
   - Regime characteristics too weak
   - Need stronger directional signals for ADX

2. **Detector calibration** (minor)
   - Thresholds may need adjustment for synthetic vs real data
   - Consider making thresholds configurable

## Conclusion

**Testing Infrastructure**: ✅ **COMPLETE** and fully functional

**Data Quality**: ⚠️ **NEEDS IMPROVEMENT** - parameters need tuning
