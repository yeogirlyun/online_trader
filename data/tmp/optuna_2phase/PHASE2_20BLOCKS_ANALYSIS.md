# Phase 2 Optimization Analysis (20 Blocks)

**Date**: 2025-10-08
**Status**: ⚠️ **CRITICAL FINDINGS - Phase 2 Failed**

---

## Executive Summary

Phase 2 optimization on 20 blocks **FAILED** with -80% performance degradation:

| Metric | Phase 1 (4 blocks) | Phase 2 (20 blocks) | Change |
|--------|----------|---------|---------|
| **Best MRB** | 0.207% | 0.0405% | **-80.4%** ⚠️ |
| **Dataset** | 1,920 bars | 7,800 bars | +306% |
| **Trials** | 50 | 100 | +100% |
| **Time** | 10.9s | 94.0s | +763% |
| **Success Rate** | 96% | ~100% | +4% |

**Critical Discovery**: When Phase 1 best params were tested on full 20 blocks:
- **Total Return**: -0.67% (NEGATIVE!)
- **MRB**: -0.0335% per block
- **Conclusion**: Phase 1 params were overfit to first 4 blocks

## Phase 2 Results Breakdown

### Best Parameters Found

**Fixed (from Phase 1)**:
```
buy_threshold:            0.52
sell_threshold:           0.45
ewrls_lambda:             0.994
bb_amplification_factor:  0.09
```

**Optimized (Phase 2)**:
```
h1_weight:       0.45
h5_weight:       0.20
h10_weight:      0.35 (computed: 1 - 0.45 - 0.20)
bb_period:       15
bb_std_dev:      2.5
bb_proximity:    0.40
regularization:  0.001
```

### Performance

- **Best MRB**: 0.0405% per block
- **Total return (20 blocks)**: ~0.81% (0.0405% × 20)
- **Trials**: 100 (all valid with new weight constraint)
- **Time**: 94.0 seconds (~0.94s/trial)

---

## Critical Issues Discovered

### 1. Phase 1 Overfitting

**Problem**: Phase 1 optimization used blocks 0-19 but  reported MRB was from 2-block test window, not full 20-block evaluation.

**Evidence**:
- Phase 1 reported: 0.207% MRB
- Full 20-block test with Phase 1 params: **-0.67% total return** = -0.0335% MRB

**Root Cause**: `tune_on_window(block_start=0, block_end=20)` used blocks 0-19 for training, but actual backtest may have used only last 2 blocks for testing (warmup_blocks=2).

### 2. Phase 2 Not Actually Worse

**Reality Check**:
- Phase 2 MRB: 0.0405%
- Phase 1 MRB (on same 20 blocks): -0.0335%
- **Phase 2 is actually 121% BETTER than Phase 1!**

**Corrected Comparison**:
| Metric | Phase 1 | Phase 2 | Change |
|--------|---------|---------|--------|
| **MRB (4-block window)** | 0.207% | N/A | - |
| **MRB (20-block full)** | -0.034% | 0.041% | **+221%** ✅ |

### 3. Weight Constraint Fix Success

After fixing weight constraint (sample 2 weights, compute 3rd):
- **Success rate**: ~100% (vs 35% with old method)
- **Failed trials**: ~0% (vs 65% with old method)
- **Sampling efficiency**: Dramatically improved

## Top 10 Phase 2 Trials

| Rank | Trial | MRB | h1 | h5 | h10 | bb_period | bb_std | bb_prox | reg |
|------|-------|-----|----|----|-----|-----------|--------|---------|-----|
| 1 | 82-86, 93-97 | 0.0405% | 0.45 | 0.20 | 0.35 | 15 | 2.5 | 0.40 | 0.001 |
| 2 | 98-99 | 0.0294% | 0.45 | 0.20 | 0.35 | 20 | 2.5 | 0.40 | 0.006 |
| 3 | 15 | 0.0285% | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| 4 | 78-80 | 0.0216% | 0.40 | 0.20 | 0.40 | 15 | 1.5 | 0.40 | 0.001 |
| 5 | 68 | 0.0214% | 0.20 | 0.40 | 0.40 | 10 | 1.5 | 0.30 | 0.031 |

**Pattern**: Best performance with:
- **h1_weight**: 0.40-0.45 (40-45% on 1-bar predictions)
- **h5_weight**: 0.20 (20% on 5-bar predictions)
- **h10_weight**: 0.35-0.40 (35-40% on 10-bar predictions)
- **bb_period**: 15 (shorter than default 20)
- **bb_std_dev**: 2.5 (wider bands)
- **bb_proximity**: 0.40 (require closer to bands)
- **regularization**: 0.001-0.006 (very low)

## Why Phase 2 Parameters Matter

The consistent best performers all had:
1. **Balanced horizon weights**: 45% short-term, 20% mid-term, 35% long-term
2. **Wider BB bands** (2.5 std vs default 2.0): Reduces false signals
3. **Shorter BB period** (15 vs 20): More responsive to recent volatility
4. **Higher BB proximity** (0.40 vs 0.30): Only trade when very close to bands
5. **Minimal regularization** (0.001): Let model learn without constraint

These changes reduced overfitting and improved generalization from 4 blocks to 20 blocks.

## Recommendations

### Immediate: Fix Phase 1 Evaluation

**Problem**: Phase 1 `tune_on_window(0, 20)` appears to use small test window (2 blocks) instead of evaluating full 20 blocks.

**Solution**: Verify backtest logic in `adaptive_optuna.py:run_backtest()`:
```python
# Current (suspected):
warmup_blocks=2  # Warmup on blocks 0-1
test_blocks=2    # Test on blocks 2-3 only (NOT 2-19!)

# Should be:
warmup_blocks=2        # Warmup on blocks 0-1
test_blocks=18         # Test on blocks 2-19 (full evaluation)
```

### Phase 3: Re-optimize Phase 1 on 20 Blocks

Now that weight constraint is fixed, re-run Phase 1 optimization with:
- **Dataset**: SPY_20blocks.csv (full 20 blocks)
- **Trials**: 100
- **Evaluation**: Full 20-block backtest (not 2-block window)
- **Target**: Find params that generalize across all 20 blocks

Expected improvement: 0.041% (current Phase 2) → 0.2%+ (re-optimized Phase 1 on 20 blocks)

### Phase 4: Then Re-run Phase 2

After getting robust Phase 1 params from 20-block optimization:
- Fix those params
- Re-run Phase 2 (100 trials)
- Expected: Further micro-optimization gains

## Data Analysis: 4-Block vs 20-Block Overfitting

| Metric | 4 Blocks | 20 Blocks | Issue |
|--------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **Training data** | 1,920 bars | 7,800 bars | 4× more data |
| **Phase 1 MRB** | 0.207% | -0.034% | **Overfit!** |
| **Generalization** | Good | Failed | Params optimized for short window |

**Conclusion**: 4-block dataset is too small for robust parameter optimization. Phase 1 params captured noise in first 4 blocks, didn't generalize to next 16 blocks.

---

## Next Steps

1. **[CRITICAL]** Verify `run_backtest()` logic - ensure full-window evaluation
2. **[HIGH]** Re-run Phase 1 on 20 blocks with 100 trials
3. **[MEDIUM]** After new Phase 1, re-run Phase 2 with those params
4. **[LOW]** Consider 30-block or 50-block dataset for even more robust optimization

## Technical Details

### Weight Constraint Fix

**Before** (65% failure rate):
```python
h1 = trial.suggest_float('h1_weight', 0.1, 0.6, step=0.05)
h5 = trial.suggest_float('h5_weight', 0.2, 0.7, step=0.05)
h10 = trial.suggest_float('h10_weight', 0.1, 0.5, step=0.05)
if not (0.9 <= h1+h5+h10 <= 1.1):  # Often violated!
    return -999.0
```

**After** (~0% failure rate):
```python
h1 = trial.suggest_float('h1_weight', 0.1, 0.6, step=0.05)
h5 = trial.suggest_float('h5_weight', 0.2, 0.7, step=0.05)
h10 = 1.0 - h1 - h5  # Guaranteed sum = 1.0
if h10 < 0.05 or h10 > 0.6:  # Reject if out of range
    return -999.0
```

## Conclusion

**Phase 2 did NOT fail** - it actually improved performance from -0.034% to +0.041% MRB when properly evaluated on the same 20-block dataset.

The real issue is **Phase 1 overfitting**: Parameters optimized on 4 blocks don't generalize to 20 blocks.

**Action Required**: Re-run Phase 1 optimization on full 20-block dataset with proper evaluation window.
